e-sports manager game

i wanted to make a game similar to EA NHL or Football Manager wherein players can create and manage esports teams.
i want the game to be as in depth as the NHL franchise (my favorite) and i will be borrowing some ideas from that game here.

each team will have 6 roster spots (+ optional bench player (probably just one for now so players cant abuse by having massive benches))
each player will have roles (i.e. lurker, anchor, opener, awper, igl, etc.) and potential (franchise, elite, star, role, bench)
each player will have preferred side (T or CT), with unique roles being applied for both sides
