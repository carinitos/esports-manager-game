e-sports manager game

i wanted to make a game similar to EA NHL or Football Manager wherein players can create and manage esports teams.
i want the game to be as in depth as the NHL franchise (my favorite) and i will be borrowing some ideas from that game here.

each team will have 6 roster spots (+ optional bench player (probably just one for now so players cant abuse by having massive benches))
each player will have roles (e.g. lurker, anchor, opener, awper, igl, etc.) and potential (franchise, elite, star, role, bench, etc)
on top of potential, each player will have a tier floor (e.g. elite tier 2 IGL might not play as well in a tier 1 team)
each player will have preferred side (T or CT), with unique roles being applied for both sides (e.g. anchor on CT and lurker on T)
each player will have their preferred weapons for rifle rounds, pistol rounds, halfbuy rounds and blowouts (e.g. chance to buy auto)
